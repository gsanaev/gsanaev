# 👋 Hi, I'm Golib Sanaev  
### Applied Data Scientist & Analyst | Python • SQL • ML • Analytics • Econometrics

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I am an **Applied Data Scientist and Analyst** with a strong foundation in **statistical modeling, data analysis, forecasting, and reproducible analytical workflows**.  
I combine **PhD-level research experience** with **practical Python & SQL skills** to build clear, interpretable, and well-structured data solutions that support decision-making.

I work extensively with **Python (pandas, scikit-learn, OOP)**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, and modern analytical tools.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **Data Science**, **Applied Machine Learning**, and **Business Analytics**.
